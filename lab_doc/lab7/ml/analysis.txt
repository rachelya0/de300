The modification with squared features and numTrees hyperparameter achieved a slightly higher AUC ROC, but only by a bit. Without the modifications, the AUC ROC = 0.8799 and selected maximum tree depth = 4. With my modifications, the AUC ROC improved to 0.8906, selected maximum tree depth = 6, and selected number of trees = 100. This suggests that the squared features contributed to the performance, as they helped capture non-linear relationships between features, thus helping generalize the model.
